# p5-starter
a template for starting new p5.js projects

To get started with p5, open terminal and execute the following commands:

1. Clone this repo with ```git clone https://github.com/paidforby/p5-starter``` 
2. Move into the repo with ```cd p5-starter``` or copy the contents in to a different folder
3. Create local copies of the p5 libraries with ```./requirments.sh```
3. Start a webserver with ```python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000``` or another preferred webserver
4. In a web browser, open http://localhost:8000

Now start messing with the ```main.js``` file to modify the script being run.
A good place to look for ideas and examples is in the p5.js reference materials, https://p5js.org/reference/
